What is the purpose of the data structure?

What is the performance of the data structure (you will need to talk about big O notation)?

What kind of problems can be solved using the data structure?

How would the data structure be used in Python (in some cases you will need to discuss recursion)?

What kind of errors are common when using the data structure? -->

### Real life examples

1. Converting infix to postfix expressions.
2. Undo operation is also carried out through stacks.
3. Syntaxes in languages are parsed using stacks.
4. Forward – backward surfing in browser
5. History of visited websites
6. Message logs and all messages you get are arranged in stack
7. Call logs, E-mails, Google photos’ any gallery , YouTube downloads, Notifications ( latest appears first )
